## Spec

Build an Obsidian plugin that auto-creates and manages sidecar `.md` files for non-markdown assets.

### Requirements
- Scaffold a new Obsidian plugin project (package.json, tsconfig, manifest.json, main.ts, styles.css)
- Listen to vault 'create' events for non-.md files and auto-create a sidecar .md file (e.g. photo.png → photo.png.md) with a frontmatter template (tags, description, source fields)
- When a non-md file is opened, auto-open its sidecar in a split pane
- Settings tab: sidecar naming pattern, watched folders (or entire vault), sidecar template content, auto-delete sidecar when source is deleted toggle
- Commands: 'Create sidecar for current file', 'Bulk-create sidecars for all non-md files without one'
- Handle rename/move: update sidecar when source file is renamed
- Use TypeScript, follow Obsidian plugin sample conventions
- Build should work with 'npm run build'
- Write a README.md with install/usage instructions
